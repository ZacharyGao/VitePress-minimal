# 1.3 定义新的函数

我们已经在 Python 中确定了强大的编程语言中一些必须出现的要素：

1. ==基本==的内置数据和函数：数字和算术运算。
2. ==组合==方式：嵌套函数。
3. 受限的==抽象==方式：将名称与值绑定。

现在我们来学习==函数定义==，这是一种更为强大的抽象技术，通过它可以将名称与复合操作绑定为一个单元。

首先来研究一下==平方==的概念。我们可能会说：“一个数乘以它本身就是平方。” 这在 Python 中可以表示为

```py
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
```

上面的代码定义了一个名为 `square` 的新函数，这个用户定义的函数并不会内置到解释器中，它表示将某值与自身相乘的复合运算。这个定义将 `x` 作为被乘的东西的名称，称为==形参（形式参数）==，同时也将此函数与名称 `square` 绑定。

==如何定义函数==：函数定义包含 `def` 语句、 `<name 函数名>` 和一个以逗号分隔的 `<formal parameters 形参>` 列表，然后是一个被称为函数体的 `return` 语句，它指定了调用函数时要计算的表达式，也就是函数的 `<return expression 返回表达式>` ：

```py
def <name>(<formal parameters>):
    return <return expression>
```

函数的第二行==必须==进行缩进 —— 大多数程序员使用四个空格。返回表达式会作为新定义的函数的一部分存储，并且仅在最终调用该函数时才进行求值。

定义了 `square` 之后，我们可以调用它：

```py
>>> square(21)
441
>>> square(add(2, 5))
49
>>> square(square(3))
81
```

我们还可以将 `square` 作为一个构建单元来定义其他函数。例如，我们可以很容易地定义一个函数 `sum_squares` ，给定任意两个数字作为参数，返回它们的平方和：

```py
>>> def sum_squares(x, y):
        return add(square(x), square(y))

>>> sum_squares(3, 4)
25
```

用户定义函数的使用方式与内置函数完全相同。实际上，从 `sum_squares` 的定义中我们并不能判断 `square` 是内置于解释器中，还是从模块中导入的，又或是由用户定义的。

`def` 语句和赋值语句都将名称与值绑定，并且绑定后任何之前的绑定都将丢失。例如，下面的 `g` 首先指的是一个没有参数的函数，然后是指一个数字，最后是一个含有两个参数的函数。

```py
>>> def g():
        return 1
>>> g()
1
>>> g = 2
>>> g
2
>>> def g(h, i):
        return h + i
>>> g(1, 2)
3
```

## 1.3.1 环境

我们的 Python 子集现在已经足够复杂，以至于程序的含义并不明显。如果形式参数与内置函数同名怎么办？两个函数可以共享名称而不会混淆吗？要解决这些问题，我们必须更详细地描述环境。

评估表达式的环境由一系列帧组成，描述为框。每个框架都包含绑定，每个绑定都将一个名称与其对应的值相关联。有一个单一的全球框架。赋值和导入语句将条目添加到当前环境的第一帧。到目前为止，我们的环境仅由全局框架组成。

This _environment diagram_ shows the bindings of the current environment, along with the values to which names are bound. The environment diagrams in this text are interactive: you can step through the lines of the small program on the left to see the state of the environment evolve on the right. You can also click on the "Edit code in Online Python Tutor" link to load the example into the [Online Python Tutor](http://composingprograms.com/tutor.html), a tool created by [Philip Guo](http://www.pgbovine.net/) for generating these environment diagrams. You are encouraged to create examples yourself and study the resulting environment diagrams.

Functions appear in environment diagrams as well. An import statement binds a name to a built-in function. A def statement binds a name to a user-defined function created by the definition. The resulting environment after importing mul and defining square appears below:

![pt_2](/sicp-python/pt_2.png)



Each function is a line that starts with func, followed by the function name and formal parameters. Built-in functions such as mul do not have formal parameter names, and so ... is always used instead.

The name of a function is repeated twice, once in the frame and again as part of the function itself. The name appearing in the function is called the _intrinsic name_. The name in a frame is a _bound name_. There is a difference between the two: different names may refer to the same function, but that function itself has only one intrinsic name.

The name bound to a function in a frame is the one used during evaluation. The intrinsic name of a function does not play a role in evaluation. Step through the example below using the _Forward_ button to see that once the name max is bound to the value 3, it can no longer be used as a function.

![pt_3](/sicp-python/pt_3.png)


The error message TypeError: 'int' object is not callable is reporting that the name max (currently bound to the number 3) is an integer and not a function. Therefore, it cannot be used as the operator in a call expression.

**Function Signatures.** Functions differ in the number of arguments that they are allowed to take. To track these requirements, we draw each function in a way that shows the function name and its formal parameters. The user-defined function square takes only x; providing more or fewer arguments will result in an error. A description of the formal parameters of a function is called the function's signature.

The function max can take an arbitrary number of arguments. It is rendered as `max(...)`. Regardless of the number of arguments taken, all built-in functions will be rendered as `<name>(...)`, because these primitive functions were never explicitly defined.

## 1.3.2 调用用户定义的函数

To evaluate a call expression whose operator names a user-defined function, the Python interpreter follows a computational process. As with any call expression, the interpreter evaluates the operator and operand expressions, and then applies the named function to the resulting arguments.

Applying a user-defined function introduces a second _local_ frame, which is only accessible to that function. To apply a user-defined function to some arguments:

1.  Bind the arguments to the names of the function's formal parameters in a new _local_ frame.
2.  Execute the body of the function in the environment that starts with this frame.

The environment in which the body is evaluated consists of two frames: first the local frame that contains formal parameter bindings, then the global frame that contains everything else. Each instance of a function application has its own independent local frame.

To illustrate an example in detail, several steps of the environment diagram for the same example are depicted below. After executing the first import statement, only the name mul is bound in the global frame.

![pt_4](/sicp-python/pt_4.png)


First, the definition statement for the function square is executed. Notice that the entire def statement is processed in a single step. The body of a function is not executed until the function is called (not when it is defined).

![pt_5](/sicp-python/pt_5.png)

Next, The square function is called with the argument -2, and so a new frame is created with the formal parameter x bound to the value -2.

![pt_6](/sicp-python/pt_6.png)

Then, the name x is looked up in the current environment, which consists of the two frames shown. In both occurrences, x evaluates to -2, and so the square function returns 4.

![pt_7](/sicp-python/pt_7.png)

The "Return value" in the square() frame is not a name binding; instead it indicates the value returned by the function call that created the frame.

Even in this simple example, two different environments are used. The top-level expression square(-2) is evaluated in the global environment, while the return expression mul(x, x) is evaluated in the environment created for by calling square. Both x and mul are bound in this environment, but in different frames.

The order of frames in an environment affects the value returned by looking up a name in an expression. We stated previously that a name is evaluated to the value associated with that name in the current environment. We can now be more precise:

**Name Evaluation.** A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found.

Our conceptual framework of environments, names, and functions constitutes a _model of evaluation_; while some mechanical details are still unspecified (e.g., how a binding is implemented), our model does precisely and correctly describe how the interpreter evaluates call expressions. In Chapter 3 we will see how this model can serve as a blueprint for implementing a working interpreter for a programming language.

## 1.3.3 示例：调用用户定义的函数

Let us again consider our two simple function definitions and illustrate the process that evaluates a call expression for a user-defined function.

![pt_8](/sicp-python/pt_8.png)

Python first evaluates the name `sum_squares`, which is bound to a user-defined function in the global frame. The primitive numeric expressions 5 and 12 evaluate to the numbers they represent.

Next, Python applies `sum_squares`, which introduces a local frame that binds x to 5 and y to 12.

![pt_9](/sicp-python/pt_9.png)

The body of sum_squares contains this call expression:

```
  add     (  square(x)  ,  square(y)  )
________     _________     _________
operator     operand 0     operand 1
```

All three subexpressions are evaluated in the current environment, which begins with the frame labeled sum_squares(). The operator subexpression add is a name found in the global frame, bound to the built-in function for addition. The two operand subexpressions must be evaluated in turn, before addition is applied. Both operands are evaluated in the current environment beginning with the frame labeled sum_squares.

In operand 0, square names a user-defined function in the global frame, while x names the number 5 in the local frame. Python applies square to 5 by introducing yet another local frame that binds x to 5.

![pt_10](/sicp-python/pt_10.png)

Using this environment, the expression `mul(x, x)` evaluates to 25.

Our evaluation procedure now turns to operand 1, for which y names the number 12. Python evaluates the body of square again, this time introducing yet another local frame that binds x to 12. Hence, operand 1 evaluates to 144.

![pt_11](/sicp-python/pt_11.png)


Finally, applying addition to the arguments 25 and 144 yields a final return value for `sum_squares`: 169.

![pt_12](/sicp-python/pt_12.png)

This example illustrates many of the fundamental ideas we have developed so far. Names are bound to values, which are distributed across many independent local frames, along with a single global frame that contains shared names. A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.

All of this machinery exists to ensure that names resolve to the correct values at the correct times during program execution. This example illustrates why our model requires the complexity that we have introduced. All three local frames contain a binding for the name x, but that name is bound to different values in different frames. Local frames keep these names separate.

## 1.3.4 局部名称

One detail of a function's implementation that should not affect the function's behavior is the implementer's choice of names for the function's formal parameters. Thus, the following functions should provide the same behavior:

```py
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
>>> def square(y):
        return mul(y, y)
```


This principle -- that the meaning of a function should be independent of the parameter names chosen by its author -- has important consequences for programming languages. The simplest consequence is that the parameter names of a function must remain local to the body of the function.

If the parameters were not local to the bodies of their respective functions, then the parameter x in square could be confused with the parameter x in sum_squares. Critically, this is not the case: the binding for x in different local frames are unrelated. The model of computation is carefully designed to ensure this independence.

We say that the _scope_ of a local name is limited to the body of the user-defined function that defines it. When a name is no longer accessible, it is out of scope. This scoping behavior isn't a new fact about our model; it is a consequence of the way environments work.


## 1.3.5 选择名称

The interchangeability of names does not imply that formal parameter names do not matter at all. On the contrary, well-chosen function and parameter names are essential for the human interpretability of function definitions!

The following guidelines are adapted from the [style guide for Python code](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), which serves as a guide for all (non-rebellious) Python programmers. A shared set of conventions smooths communication among members of a developer community. As a side effect of following these conventions, you will find that your code becomes more internally consistent.

1.  Function names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Descriptive names are encouraged.
2.  Function names typically evoke operations applied to arguments by the interpreter (e.g., print, add, square) or the name of the quantity that results (e.g., max, abs, sum).
3.  Parameter names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Single-word names are preferred.
4.  Parameter names should evoke the role of the parameter in the function, not just the kind of argument that is allowed.
5.  Single letter parameter names are acceptable when their role is obvious, but avoid "l" (lowercase ell), "O" (capital oh), or "I" (capital i) to avoid confusion with numerals.

There are many exceptions to these guidelines, even in the Python standard library. Like the vocabulary of the English language, Python has inherited words from a variety of contributors, and the result is not always consistent.

## 1.3.6 作为抽象的函数

Though it is very simple, sum_squares exemplifies the most powerful property of user-defined functions. The function sum_squares is defined in terms of the function square, but relies only on the relationship that square defines between its input arguments and its output values.

We can write sum_squares without concerning ourselves with _how_ to square a number. The details of how the square is computed can be suppressed, to be considered at a later time. Indeed, as far as sum_squares is concerned, square is not a particular function body, but rather an abstraction of a function, a so-called functional abstraction. At this level of abstraction, any function that computes the square is equally good.

Thus, considering only the values they return, the following two functions for squaring a number should be indistinguishable. Each takes a numerical argument and produces the square of that number as the value.

```py
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x)
>>> def square(x):
        return mul(x, x-1) + x
```

In other words, a function definition should be able to suppress details. The users of the function may not have written the function themselves, but may have obtained it from another programmer as a "black box". A programmer should not need to know how the function is implemented in order to use it. The Python Library has this property. Many developers use the functions defined there, but few ever inspect their implementation.

**Aspects of a functional abstraction.** To master the use of a functional abstraction, it is often useful to consider its three core attributes. The _domain_ of a function is the set of arguments it can take. The _range_ of a function is the set of values it can return. The _intent_ of a function is the relationship it computes between inputs and output (as well as any side effects it might generate). Understanding functional abstractions via their domain, range, and intent is critical to using them correctly in a complex program.

For example, any square function that we use to implement sum_squares should have these attributes:

-   The _domain_ is any single real number.
-   The _range_ is any non-negative real number.
-   The _intent_ is that the output is the square of the input.

These attributes do not specify how the intent is carried out; that detail is abstracted away.

## 1.3.7 操作符

Mathematical operators (such as + and -) provided our first example of a method of combination, but we have yet to define an evaluation procedure for expressions that contain these operators.

Python expressions with infix operators each have their own evaluation procedures, but you can often think of them as short-hand for call expressions. When you see

```py
>>> 2 + 3
5
```

simply consider it to be short-hand for

```py
>>> add(2, 3)
5
```

Infix notation can be nested, just like call expressions. Python applies the normal mathematical rules of operator precedence, which dictate how to interpret a compound expression with multiple operators.

```py
>>> 2 + 3 * 4 + 5
19
```

evaluates to the same result as

```py
>>> add(add(2, mul(3, 4)), 5)
19
```

The nesting in the call expression is more explicit than the operator version, but also harder to read. Python also allows subexpression grouping with parentheses, to override the normal precedence rules or make the nested structure of an expression more explicit.

```py
>>> (2 + 3) * (4 + 5)
45
```

evaluates to the same result as

```py
>>> mul(add(2, 3), add(4, 5))
45
```

When it comes to division, Python provides two infix operators: / and //. The former is normal division, so that it results in a _floating point_, or decimal value, even if the divisor evenly divides the dividend:

```py
>>> 5 / 4
1.25
>>> 8 / 4
2.0
```

The // operator, on the other hand, rounds the result down to an integer:

```py
>>> 5 // 4
1
>>> -5 // 4
-2
```

These two operators are shorthand for the truediv and floordiv functions.

```py
>>> from operator import truediv, floordiv
>>> truediv(5, 4)
1.25
>>> floordiv(5, 4)
1
```

You should feel free to use infix operators and parentheses in your programs. Idiomatic Python prefers operators over call expressions for simple mathematical operations.
