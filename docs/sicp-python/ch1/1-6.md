我们已经看到，函数其实是一种抽象方法，它描述了与特定参数值无关的的复合操作。

```py
>>> def square(x):
        return x * x
```

也就是说，在 `square` 中我们并不是在讨论一个特定数字的平方，而是在讨论一种获得任何数字平方的方法。当然，我们也可以在不定义这个函数的情况下得到结果，而是通过写下面的表达式来计算平方，并且从不显式地提到 `square`。

```py
>>> 3 * 3
9
>>> 5 * 5
25
```

这种做法对于诸如 `square` 之类的简单计算是足够的，但对于诸如 `abs` 或 `fib` 之类的更复杂的样例就会变得很费力。一般来说，缺少函数定义会对我们非常不利，迫使我们总是工作在特定的操作级别（这在语言中非常原始，本例中为乘法），而不是更高级的操作级别。我们的程序将能够计算平方，但却不能表达平方的概念。

我们对强大的编程语言提出的要求之一是能够通过将名称分配给通用模板（general patterns）来构建抽象，然后直接根据名称进行工作。函数提供了这种能力。正如我们将在下面的示例中看到的那样，代码中重复出现了一些常见的编程模板，但它们可以与许多不同的函数一起使用。这些模板也可以通过给它们命名来进行抽象。

为了将某些通用模板表达为具名概念，我们需要构造“可以接收其他函数作为参数”或“可以把函数当作返回值”的函数。操作函数的函数称为高阶函数（higher-order functions）。本节展示高阶函数可作为强大的抽象机制来极大地提高我们语言的表达能力。

## 1.6.1 作为参数的函数

思考以下三个计算求和的函数。第一个 `sum_naturals` 计算直到 `n` 的自然数之和：

```py
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total

>>> sum_naturals(100)
5050
```

第二个 `sum_cubes` 函数计算直到 `n` 的自然数的立方之和。

```py
>>> def sum_cubes(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k*k*k, k + 1
        return total

>>> sum_cubes(100)
25502500
```

第三个 `pi_sum` 计算下图中各项的总和，它会非常缓慢地收敛到 $\pi$ 。

![pi_sum](/sicp-python/pi_sum.png)

```py
>>> def pi_sum(n):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + 8 / ((4*k-3) * (4*k-1)), k + 1
        return total

>>> pi_sum(100)
3.1365926848388144
```

这三个函数显然在背后共享着一个通用的模板（pattern）。它们在很大程度上是相同的，仅在名称和用于计算被加项 `k` 的函数上有所不同。我们可以通过在同一模板中填充槽位（slots）来生成每个函数：

```py
def <name>(n):
    total, k = 0, 1
    while k <= n:
        total, k = total + <term>(k), k + 1
    return total
```

这种通用模板的存在是一个强有力的证据，表明有一个实用的抽象正在“浮出水面”。这些函数中的每一个都是各项的总和。作为程序设计者，我们希望我们的语言足够强大，以便我们可以编写一个表达“求和”这个概念本身的函数，而不仅仅是一个计算特定和的函数。在 Python 中，我们可以很轻易地做到这一点，方法就是使用上面展示的通用模板，并且将“槽位”转换为形式参数：

在下面的示例中，`summation` 函数将上界 `n` 和计算第 `k` 项的函数 `term` 作为其两个参数。我们可以像使用任何函数一样使用 `summation` ，它简洁地表达了求和。花点时间单步调试（step through）走完这个示例，并注意如何将 `cube` 函数绑定到局部名称 `term` 以确保 $1\times 1\times 1 + 2\times 2\times 2 + 3\times 3\times 3 = 36$ 计算结果正确。在这个例子中，不需要的帧将被移除以节省空间。

使用返回其参数的 `identity` 函数，我们还可以使用完全相同的 `summation` 函数对自然数求和。

```py
>>> def summation(n, term):
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + term(k), k + 1
        return total
>>> def identity(x):
        return x
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        return summation(n, identity)
>>> sum_naturals(10)
55
```

`summation` 函数也可以直接调用，而无需为特定的数列定义另一个函数。

```py
>>> summation(10, square)
385
```

可以定义 `pi_term` 函数来计算每一项的值，从而使用我们对 `summation` 的抽象来定义 `pi_sum` 函数。传入参数 `1e6`（1 * 10<sup>6</sup> = 1000000 的简写）以计算 $\pi$ 的近似值。

```py
>>> def pi_term(x):
        return 8 / ((4*x-3) * (4*x-1))
>>> def pi_sum(n):
        return summation(n, pi_term)
>>> pi_sum(1e6)
3.141592153589902
```

## 1.6.2 作为通用方法的函数

We introduced user-defined functions as a mechanism for abstracting patterns of numerical operations so as to make them independent of the particular numbers involved. With higher-order functions, we begin to see a more powerful kind of abstraction: some functions express general methods of computation, independent of the particular functions they call.

Despite this conceptual extension of what a function means, our environment model of how to evaluate a call expression extends gracefully to the case of higher-order functions, without change. When a user-defined function is applied to some arguments, the formal parameters are bound to the values of those arguments (which may be functions) in a new local frame.

Consider the following example, which implements a general method for iterative improvement and uses it to compute the [golden ratio](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~demo5337/s97b/art.htm). The golden ratio, often called "phi", is a number near 1.6 that appears frequently in nature, art, and architecture.

An iterative improvement algorithm begins with a guess of a solution to an equation. It repeatedly applies an update function to improve that guess, and applies a close comparison to check whether the current guess is "close enough" to be considered correct.

```py
>>> def improve(update, close, guess=1):
        while not close(guess):
            guess = update(guess)
        return guess
```

This improve function is a general expression of repetitive refinement. It doesn't specify what problem is being solved: those details are left to the update and close functions passed in as arguments.

Among the well-known properties of the golden ratio are that it can be computed by repeatedly summing the inverse of any positive number with 1, and that it is one less than its square. We can express these properties as functions to be used with improve.

```py
>>> def golden_update(guess):
        return 1/guess + 1

>>> def square_close_to_successor(guess):
        return approx_eq(guess * guess, guess + 1)
```

Above, we introduce a call to approx_eq that is meant to return True if its arguments are approximately equal to each other. To implement, approx_eq, we can compare the absolute value of the difference between two numbers to a small tolerance value.

```py
>>> def approx_eq(x, y, tolerance=1e-15):
        return abs(x - y) < tolerance
```

Calling improve with the arguments golden_update and square_close_to_successor will compute a finite approximation to the golden ratio.

```py
>>> improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
1.6180339887498951
```

By tracing through the steps of evaluation, we can see how this result is computed. First, a local frame for improve is constructed with bindings for update, close, and guess. In the body of improve, the name close is bound to square_close_to_successor, which is called on the initial value of guess. Trace through the rest of the steps to see the computational process that evolves to compute the golden ratio.

This example illustrates two related big ideas in computer science. First, naming and functions allow us to abstract away a vast amount of complexity. While each function definition has been trivial, the computational process set in motion by our evaluation procedure is quite intricate. Second, it is only by virtue of the fact that we have an extremely general evaluation procedure for the Python language that small components can be composed into complex processes. Understanding the procedure of interpreting programs allows us to validate and inspect the process we have created.

As always, our new general method improve needs a test to check its correctness. The golden ratio can provide such a test, because it also has an exact closed-form solution, which we can compare to this iterative result.

```py
>>> from math import sqrt
>>> phi = 1/2 + sqrt(5)/2
>>> def improve_test():
        approx_phi = improve(golden_update, square_close_to_successor)
        assert approx_eq(phi, approx_phi), 'phi differs from its approximation'
>>> improve_test()
```

For this test, no news is good news: improve_test returns None after its assert statement is executed successfully.

## 1.6.3 定义函数 III：嵌套定义

The above examples demonstrate how the ability to pass functions as arguments significantly enhances the expressive power of our programming language. Each general concept or equation maps onto its own short function. One negative consequence of this approach is that the global frame becomes cluttered with names of small functions, which must all be unique. Another problem is that we are constrained by particular function signatures: the update argument to improve must take exactly one argument. Nested function definitions address both of these problems, but require us to enrich our environment model.

Let's consider a new problem: computing the square root of a number. In programming languages, "square root" is often abbreviated as sqrt. Repeated application of the following update converges to the square root of a:

```py
>>> def average(x, y):
        return (x + y)/2

>>> def sqrt_update(x, a):
        return average(x, a/x)
```

This two-argument update function is incompatible with improve (it takes two arguments, not one), and it provides only a single update, while we really care about taking square roots by repeated updates. The solution to both of these issues is to place function definitions inside the body of other definitions.

```py
>>> def sqrt(a):
        def sqrt_update(x):
            return average(x, a/x)
        def sqrt_close(x):
            return approx_eq(x * x, a)
        return improve(sqrt_update, sqrt_close)
```

Like local assignment, local def statements only affect the current local frame. These functions are only in scope while sqrt is being evaluated. Consistent with our evaluation procedure, these local def statements don't even get evaluated until sqrt is called.

**Lexical scope.** Locally defined functions also have access to the name bindings in the scope in which they are defined. In this example, sqrt_update refers to the name a, which is a formal parameter of its enclosing function sqrt. This discipline of sharing names among nested definitions is called _lexical scoping_. Critically, the inner functions have access to the names in the environment where they are defined (not where they are called).

We require two extensions to our environment model to enable lexical scoping.

1.  Each user-defined function has a parent environment: the environment in which it was defined.
2.  When a user-defined function is called, its local frame extends its parent environment.

Previous to sqrt, all functions were defined in the global environment, and so they all had the same parent: the global environment. By contrast, when Python evaluates the first two clauses of sqrt, it create functions that are associated with a local environment. In the call

```py
>>> sqrt(256)
16.0
```

the environment first adds a local frame for sqrt and evaluates the def statements for sqrt_update and sqrt_close.

Function values each have a new annotation that we will include in environment diagrams from now on, a parent. The parent of a function value is the first frame of the environment in which that function was defined. Functions without parent annotations were defined in the global environment. When a user-defined function is called, the frame created has the same parent as that function.

Subsequently, the name sqrt_update resolves to this newly defined function, which is passed as an argument to improve. Within the body of improve, we must apply our update function (bound to sqrt_update) to the initial guess x of 1. This final application creates an environment for sqrt_update that begins with a local frame containing only x, but with the parent frame sqrt still containing a binding for a.

The most critical part of this evaluation procedure is the transfer of the parent for sqrt_update to the frame created by calling sqrt_update. This frame is also annotated with [parent=f1].

**Extended Environments**. An environment can consist of an arbitrarily long chain of frames, which always concludes with the global frame. Previous to this sqrt example, environments had at most two frames: a local frame and the global frame. By calling functions that were defined within other functions, via nested def statements, we can create longer chains. The environment for this call to sqrt_update consists of three frames: the local sqrt_update frame, the sqrt frame in which sqrt_update was defined (labeled f1), and the global frame.

The return expression in the body of sqrt_update can resolve a value for a by following this chain of frames. Looking up a name finds the first value bound to that name in the current environment. Python checks first in the sqrt_update frame -- no a exists. Python checks next in the parent frame, f1, and finds a binding for a to 256.

Hence, we realize two key advantages of lexical scoping in Python.

-   The names of a local function do not interfere with names external to the function in which it is defined, because the local function name will be bound in the current local environment in which it was defined, rather than the global environment.
-   A local function can access the environment of the enclosing function, because the body of the local function is evaluated in an environment that extends the evaluation environment in which it was defined.

The sqrt_update function carries with it some data: the value for a referenced in the environment in which it was defined. Because they "enclose" information in this way, locally defined functions are often called _closures_.


## 1.6.4 作为返回值的函数

We can achieve even more expressive power in our programs by creating functions whose returned values are themselves functions. An important feature of lexically scoped programming languages is that locally defined functions maintain their parent environment when they are returned. The following example illustrates the utility of this feature.

Once many simple functions are defined, function composition is a natural method of combination to include in our programming language. That is, given two functions f(x) and g(x), we might want to define h(x) = f(g(x)). We can define function composition using our existing tools:

```py
>>> def compose1(f, g):
        def h(x):
            return f(g(x))
        return h
```

The environment diagram for this example shows how the names f and g are resolved correctly, even in the presence of conflicting names.

<iframe width="100%" height="800" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20square%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20x%20*%20x%0A%0Adef%20successor%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20x%20%2B%201%0A%0Adef%20compose1%28f,%20g%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20def%20h%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20return%20f%28g%28x%29%29%0A%20%20%20%20return%20h%0A%0Adef%20f%28x%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%22%22%22Never%20called.%22%22%22%0A%20%20%20%20return%20-x%0A%0Asquare_successor%20%3D%20compose1%28square,%20successor%29%0Aresult%20%3D%20square_successor%2812%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=true&curInstr=0&origin=composingprograms.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D"> </iframe>

The 1 in compose1 is meant to signify that the composed functions all take a single argument. This naming convention is not enforced by the interpreter; the 1 is just part of the function name.

At this point, we begin to observe the benefits of our effort to define precisely the environment model of computation. No modification to our environment model is required to explain our ability to return functions in this way.

## 1.6.5 示例: 牛顿法

This extended example shows how function return values and local definitions can work together to express general ideas concisely. We will implement an algorithm that is used broadly in machine learning, scientific computing, hardware design, and optimization.

Newton's method is a classic iterative approach to finding the arguments of a mathematical function that yield a return value of 0. These values are called the _zeros_ of the function. Finding a zero of a function is often equivalent to solving some other problem of interest, such as computing a square root.

A motivating comment before we proceed: it is easy to take for granted the fact that we know how to compute square roots. Not just Python, but your phone, web browser, or pocket calculator can do so for you. However, part of learning computer science is understanding how quantities like these can be computed, and the general approach presented here is applicable to solving a large class of equations beyond those built into Python.

Newton's method is an iterative improvement algorithm: it improves a guess of the zero for any function that is _differentiable_, which means that it can be approximated by a straight line at any point. Newton's method follows these linear approximations to find function zeros.

Imagine a line through the point $(x,f(x))$ that has the same slope as the curve for function $f(x)$ at that point. Such a line is called the _tangent_, and its slope is called the _derivative_ of $f$ at $x$.

This line's slope is the ratio of the change in function value to the change in function argument. Hence, translating $x$ by $f(x)$ divided by the slope will give the argument value at which this tangent line touches 0.



![newton](/sicp-python/newton.png)

A newton_update expresses the computational process of following this tangent line to 0, for a function f and its derivative df.

```py
>>> def newton_update(f, df):
        def update(x):
            return x - f(x) / df(x)
        return update
```

Finally, we can define the find_root function in terms of newton_update, our improve algorithm, and a comparison to see if f(x) is near 0.

```py
>>> def find_zero(f, df):
        def near_zero(x):
            return approx_eq(f(x), 0)
        return improve(newton_update(f, df), near_zero)
```

**Computing Roots.** Using Newton's method, we can compute roots of arbitrary degree n. The degree n root of a is x such that x⋅x⋅x…x=a with x repeated n times. For example,

-   The square (second) root of 64 is 8, because 8⋅8=648⋅8=64.
-   The cube (third) root of 64 is 4, because 4⋅4⋅4=644⋅4⋅4=64.
-   The sixth root of 64 is 2, because 2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2=642⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2⋅2=64.

We can compute roots using Newton's method with the following observations:

-   The square root of 64 (written $√64$) is the value $x$ such that $x2−64=0$
-   More generally, the degree n root of a (written a−−√n) is the value x such that $xn−a=0$

If we can find a zero of this last equation, then we can compute degree n roots. By plotting the curves for n equal to 2, 3, and 6 and a equal to 64, we can visualize this relationship.

![curves](/sicp-python/curves.png)


We first implement square_root by defining f and its derivative df. We use from calculus the fact that the derivative of $f(x)=x2−a$ is the linear function $df(x)=2x$.

```py
>>> def square_root_newton(a):
        def f(x):
            return x * x - a
        def df(x):
            return 2 * x
        return find_zero(f, df)

>>> square_root_newton(64)
8.0
```

Generalizing to roots of arbitrary degree $n$, we compute $f(x)=xn−a$ and its derivative $df(x)=n⋅xn−1$.

```py
>>> def power(x, n):
        """Return x * x * x * ... * x for x repeated n times."""
        product, k = 1, 0
        while k < n:
            product, k = product * x, k + 1
        return product

>>> def nth_root_of_a(n, a):
        def f(x):
            return power(x, n) - a
        def df(x):
            return n * power(x, n-1)
        return find_zero(f, df)

>>> nth_root_of_a(2, 64)
8.0
>>> nth_root_of_a(3, 64)
4.0
>>> nth_root_of_a(6, 64)
2.0
```

The approximation error in all of these computations can be reduced by changing the tolerance in approx_eq to a smaller number.

As you experiment with Newton's method, be aware that it will not always converge. The initial guess of improve must be sufficiently close to the zero, and various conditions about the function must be met. Despite this shortcoming, Newton's method is a powerful general computational method for solving differentiable equations. Very fast algorithms for logarithms and large integer division employ variants of the technique in modern computers.

## 1.6.6 柯里化

We can use higher-order functions to convert a function that takes multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. More specifically, given a function f(x, y), we can define a function g such that g(x)(y) is equivalent to f(x, y). Here, g is a higher-order function that takes in a single argument x and returns another function that takes in a single argument y. This transformation is called currying.

As an example, we can define a curried version of the pow function:

```py
>>> def curried_pow(x):
        def h(y):
            return pow(x, y)
        return h
>>> curried_pow(2)(3)
8
```

Some programming languages, such as Haskell, only allow functions that take a single argument, so the programmer must curry all multi-argument procedures. In more general languages such as Python, currying is useful when we require a function that takes in only a single argument. For example, the map pattern applies a single-argument function to a sequence of values. In later chapters, we will see more general examples of the map pattern, but for now, we can implement the pattern in a function:

```py
>>> def map_to_range(start, end, f):
        while start < end:
            print(f(start))
            start = start + 1
```

We can use map_to_range and curried_pow to compute the first ten powers of two, rather than specifically writing a function to do so:

```py
>>> map_to_range(0, 10, curried_pow(2))
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
256
512
```

We can similarly use the same two functions to compute powers of other numbers. Currying allows us to do so without writing a specific function for each number whose powers we wish to compute.

In the above examples, we manually performed the currying transformation on the pow function to obtain curried_pow. Instead, we can define functions to automate currying, as well as the inverse uncurrying transformation:

```py
>>> def curry2(f):
        """Return a curried version of the given two-argument function."""
        def g(x):
            def h(y):
                return f(x, y)
            return h
        return g
>>> def uncurry2(g):
        """Return a two-argument version of the given curried function."""
        def f(x, y):
            return g(x)(y)
        return f
>>> pow_curried = curry2(pow)
>>> pow_curried(2)(5)
32
>>> map_to_range(0, 10, pow_curried(2))
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
256
512
```

The curry2 function takes in a two-argument function f and returns a single-argument function g. When g is applied to an argument x, it returns a single-argument function h. When h is applied to y, it calls f(x, y). Thus, curry2(f)(x)(y) is equivalent to f(x, y). The uncurry2 function reverses the currying transformation, so that uncurry2(curry2(f)) is equivalent to f.

```py
>>> uncurry2(pow_curried)(2, 5)
32
```

## 1.6.7 Lambda 表达式

So far, each time we have wanted to define a new function, we needed to give it a name. But for other types of expressions, we don't need to associate intermediate values with a name. That is, we can compute a*b + c*d without having to name the subexpressions a*b or c*d, or the full expression. In Python, we can create function values on the fly using lambda expressions, which evaluate to unnamed functions. A lambda expression evaluates to a function that has a single return expression as its body. Assignment and control statements are not allowed.

```py
>>> def compose1(f, g):
        return lambda x: f(g(x))
```

We can understand the structure of a lambda expression by constructing a corresponding English sentence:

```
     lambda            x            :          f(g(x))
"A function that    takes x    and returns     f(g(x))"
```

The result of a lambda expression is called a lambda function. It has no intrinsic name (and so Python prints `<lambda>` for the name), but otherwise it behaves like any other function.

```py
>>> s = lambda x: x * x
>>> s
<function <lambda> at 0xf3f490>
>>> s(12)
144
```

In an environment diagram, the result of a lambda expression is a function as well, named with the greek letter λ (lambda). Our compose example can be expressed quite compactly with lambda expressions.

Some programmers find that using unnamed functions from lambda expressions to be shorter and more direct. However, compound lambda expressions are notoriously illegible, despite their brevity. The following definition is correct, but many programmers have trouble understanding it quickly.

```py
>>> compose1 = lambda f,g: lambda x: f(g(x))
```

In general, Python style prefers explicit def statements to lambda expressions, but allows them in cases where a simple function is needed as an argument or return value.

Such stylistic rules are merely guidelines; you can program any way you wish. However, as you write programs, think about the audience of people who might read your program one day. When you can make your program easier to understand, you do those people a favor.

The term lambda is a historical accident resulting from the incompatibility of written mathematical notation and the constraints of early type-setting systems.

> It may seem perverse to use lambda to introduce a procedure/function. The notation goes back to Alonzo Church, who in the 1930's started with a "hat" symbol; he wrote the square function as "ŷ . y × y". But frustrated typographers moved the hat to the left of the parameter and changed it to a capital lambda: "Λy . y × y"; from there the capital lambda was changed to lowercase, and now we see "λy . y × y" in math books and (lambda (y) (* y y)) in Lisp.

Despite their unusual etymology, lambda expressions and the corresponding formal language for function application, the _lambda calculus_, are fundamental computer science concepts shared far beyond the Python programming community. We will revisit this topic when we study the design of interpreters in Chapter 3.

## 1.6.8 抽象和一等函数

We began this section with the observation that user-defined functions are a crucial abstraction mechanism, because they permit us to express general methods of computing as explicit elements in our programming language. Now we've seen how higher-order functions permit us to manipulate these general methods to create further abstractions.

As programmers, we should be alert to opportunities to identify the underlying abstractions in our programs, build upon them, and generalize them to create more powerful abstractions. This is not to say that one should always write programs in the most abstract way possible; expert programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task. But it is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts. The significance of higher-order functions is that they enable us to represent these abstractions explicitly as elements in our programming language, so that they can be handled just like other computational elements.

In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have first-class status. Some of the "rights and privileges" of first-class elements are:

1.  They may be bound to names.
2.  They may be passed as arguments to functions.
3.  They may be returned as the results of functions.
4.  They may be included in data structures.

Python awards functions full first-class status, and the resulting gain in expressive power is enormous.

## 1.6.9 函数装饰器

Python provides special syntax to apply higher-order functions as part of executing a def statement, called a decorator. Perhaps the most common example is a trace.

```py
>>> def trace(fn):
        def wrapped(x):
            print('-> ', fn, '(', x, ')')
            return fn(x)
        return wrapped
>>> @trace
    def triple(x):
        return 3 * x
>>> triple(12)
->  <function triple at 0x102a39848> ( 12 )
36
```

In this example, A higher-order function trace is defined, which returns a function that precedes a call to its argument with a print statement that outputs the argument. The def statement for triple has an annotation, @trace, which affects the execution rule for def. As usual, the function triple is created. However, the name triple is not bound to this function. Instead, the name triple is bound to the returned function value of calling trace on the newly defined triple function. In code, this decorator is equivalent to:

```py
>>> def triple(x):
        return 3 * x
>>> triple = trace(triple)
```

In the projects associated with this text, decorators are used for tracing, as well as selecting which functions to call when a program is run from the command line.

**Extra for experts.** The decorator symbol @ may also be followed by a call expression. The expression following @ is evaluated first (just as the name trace was evaluated above), the def statement second, and finally the result of evaluating the decorator expression is applied to the newly defined function, and the result is bound to the name in the def statement. A [short tutorial on decorators](http://programmingbits.pythonblogs.com/27_programmingbits/archive/50_function_decorators.html) by Ariel Ortiz gives further examples for interested students.
